# SD-Project
# Portable Water Filtration and Purification
Our project is based using Arduino's IoT Cloud to send a receieve data. Here you'll find two sketches that were used for the microcontrollers in order to communicate to clouds via the internet. All data is then processed through variables to which we can plot and/or use as coordinates for arduinos built-in dashboard which is what essentially makes the User-Intefact in our app integration.
